# üìä First Day - Correlation, Covariance LM & Training

This project focuses on analyzing correlations and covariances between various datasets, as well as training and practical exercises from the book "Data Science with R".

## üöÄ Introduction

This project performs a series of steps to read, analyze, and visualize data. It includes:

- Loading CSV files with data.
- Calculating BMI and statistical measures.
- Performing loops for data analysis.
- Utilizing functions to compute covariance and correlation.

## üìÅ Contents

- **ReadCSV, Loops, URLconnection, Matrix, Str, LM.R**: Scripts for loading data and performing basic analyses.
- **Covariance & Correlation - Part 1.R**: Script for calculating and visualizing covariance and correlation.
- **Covariance & Correlation - Part 2.R**: Continuation of the previous script with additional analyses.
- **Training from the book**: Folder containing all exercises from the book "Data Science with R".

## üìä Data Analysis

The scripts perform the following:

### Loading Data:

- The CSV files `wq.csv` and `hwg.csv` are loaded.
- Data is analyzed with functions like `str()` and `summary()` to understand the variables.

### BMI Calculation:

- A new column is added to the `hwg` dataframe to compute BMI using the formula: `BMI = Weight / (Height / 100)^2`.

### Loops:

- `for` loops are used to iterate over the data, generate URLs, and print relevant information.

### Covariance and Correlation Calculation:

- Custom functions to calculate mean, covariance, and correlation are implemented.
- Correlation matrices are visualized using `corrplot` and `ggcorrplot`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies

- **R**: The analysis and visualization environment.
- **corrplot, ggplot2, ggcorrplot**: Packages used for data visualization.

## üìå Requirements

- R and RStudio must be installed on your machine.
- The following packages should be installed:
    ```r
    install.packages(c("corrplot", "ggplot2", "ggcorrplot"))
    ```
